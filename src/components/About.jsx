                Hey there! I'm Andrew, a recent graduate from the University of South Australia with a Bachelor of Software Development. I have a passion for problem-solving, full-stack development, and data visualization. I love turning ideas into visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional web applications.

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve worked on projects that leverage React, ASP.NET Core, Node.js, and RESTful APIs, focusing on real-world solutions, such as road safety data visualization and AI-powered information extraction. I thrive in collaborative environments, applying agile methodologies and working closely with teams to deliver impactful software solutions.

I'm always looking to learn, grow, and build innovative applications that make a difference. Feel free to connectâ€”letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸš€                   </p>
